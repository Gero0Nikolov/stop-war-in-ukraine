== Description ==

Stop War In Ukraine - Firewall,<br>
simply installs a firewall that restricts Russian traffic from your website. Together we can stop the madness of war!
It integrates the <a href="https://redirectrussia.org/" target="_blank">redirectrussia.org</a> thirdparty functionality within any WordPress based website, with just a click.

<strong>How it works ?</strong>
<br>
Once the plugin is active your website will start listening for traffic coming from Russia which will be redirected to the URL specified by the Plugin Settings page.
The site administrator can choose if the redirection should happen to a generic landing page or a custom URL.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin

Alternative:
Download and activate the plugin from WordPress.org or
clone the repository from GitHub - https://github.com/Gero0Nikolov/stop-war-in-ukraine -
to your wp-content/wp-plugins/ folder and activate it from the WordPress Dashboard after that.
