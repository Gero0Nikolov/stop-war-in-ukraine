# Stop War In Ukraine - WordPress Plugin

The SWIU WP Plugin simply installs a firewall that restricts Russian traffic from your website. Together we can stop the madness of war!
It integrates the [redirectrussia.org](https://redirectrussia.org/) thirdparty functionality within any WordPress based website, with just a click.

## Instalation:
1) Clone the repository to your local / website server **wp-content/plugins** folder.
2) Activate the plugin through the WP Dashboard.
3) That's it!

## Usage:
Once the plugin is active your website will start listening for traffic coming from Russia which will be redirected to the URL specified by the Plugin Settings page.
The site administrator can choose if the redirection should happen to a generic landing page or a custom URL.

#### Let's stop the war together!
